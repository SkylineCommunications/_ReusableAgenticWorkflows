  Automated release note writer that runs when a pull request is merged.
  Reads the PR diff and any linked issues, then posts a plain-language release
  note entry as a comment — written for a changelog audience rather than for
  PR reviewers. The comment includes a machine-readable anchor so a downstream
  publish workflow can push it to an external release note platform when a
  publish-rn label is applied.
